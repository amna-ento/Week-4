# The Prompt Lab — Task Plan

## 1. What to build?

We need to build a small CLI tool that tests different prompting techniques on the ames task and same 20 inputs.

The main goal is NOT just to show that we know different prompting techniques.

The important part is:

> We need to experimentally compare four different prompts and use actual scores to decide which prompt works best.


So this is basically a small Prompt Engineering experiment.

---

# 4. The four prompt versions

We need exactly four versions.

## Prompt 1: Naive

This is the simplest possible prompt.

No examples.

No special structure.

No advanced prompting technique.

This tells us how well the model performs with a basic prompt.

---

## Prompt 2: Few shot

Here we give the model a few examples before giving it the real input.

For example:

Example 1:

Input:
"Data Scientist with 3 years of Python and SQL experience."

Then another example.

Then the actual job description.

---

## Prompt 3: Chain of thought

Here we ask the model to reason through the problem before producing the answer.

Conceptually:

1. Identify the job title.
2. Find experience requirements.
3. Identify technical skills.
4. Identify work arrangement.
5. Produce the final answer.

Important:

We should be careful about how we implement this.

For our experiment, we can ask the model for a concise reasoning process or intermediate analysis rather than trying to capture hidden reasoning.

The important thing is to test whether adding a reasoning step improves extraction accuracy.

---

## Prompt 4: Structured output enforced

Here we strongly enforce the output format.

For example:

Return ONLY valid JSON using this schema:

{
    "job_title": "string",
    "experience_years": "number or null",
    "skills": ["string"],
    "work_type": "string or null"
}

No explanation and No extra text.

# 5. We need a ground truth

This is one of the most important parts of the assignment.

We cannot simply say:

"Prompt 4 looks better."

We need to define what the correct answer is.

For every input, we should have an expected output.

Example:

Input:

"Backend Developer required with 3 years of Python experience. Experience with FastAPI and PostgreSQL preferred. Remote."

Expected:

{
    "job_title": "Backend Developer",
    "experience_years": 3,
    "skills": ["Python", "FastAPI", "PostgreSQL"],
    "work_type": "Remote"
}

This expected answer is called our:

Ground Truth

---

# 6. What does "correct" mean?

Before running the experiment we need to define our scoring rules.

For example we could score each extracted field separately.

Fields:

- job_title
- experience_years
- skills
- work_type

Suppose the model produces:

{
    "job_title": "Backend Developer",
    "experience_years": 3,
    "skills": ["Python", "FastAPI"],
    "work_type": "Remote"
}

But the ground truth says:

{
    "job_title": "Backend Developer",
    "experience_years": 3,
    "skills": ["Python", "FastAPI", "PostgreSQL"],
    "work_type": "Remote"
}

Then:

job_title → correct
experience_years → correct
skills → partially correct
work_type → correct

This gives us something measurable,in tge percentage form.

---

# 7. What should we score?

We should measure multiple things.

## A. Accuracy

How often did the model extract the correct information?

Example:

18 correct fields out of 20

Accuracy = 90%

---

## B. Format validity

Especially important for the structured output prompt.

Example:

20 outputs generated.

19 are valid JSON.

Format validity = 95%

This measures whether the model followed our required structure.

---

## C. Completeness

Did the model extract all required information?

For example:

Expected skills:

["Python", "FastAPI", "PostgreSQL"]

Model:

["Python"]

The output may be valid, but it is incomplete.

---

## D. Overall score

We can combine our measurements into a final score.

For example:

Overall Score =
field accuracy + completeness + format validity

We will decide the exact scoring formula BEFORE running the experiment.

That makes the experiment fair.

---

# 8. The CLI tool

The assignment specifically asks for a small CLI tool.

So eventually we should be able to run something like:

python main.py

or something similar.

The CLI should:

1. Load the 20 test inputs.
2. Load the four prompt files.
3. Send each input through each prompt.
4. Collect the model responses.
5. Compare responses with the ground truth.
6. Calculate scores.
7. display the results.

Conceptually:

                            20 Inputs
                                |
          +-------------+---------------------------+
          |             |             |             |
       Naive        Few shot          CoT       Structured
          |             |             |             |
          +-------------+-------------+-------------+
                                |
                              Results
                                |
                              Scoring
                                |
                            Comparison
                                |
                           Final Winner


# 9. Prompt files

The assignment specifically says: Prompts stored in version controlled files, not inline strings.

This means we should NOT do this:

prompt = "You are an AI..."

inside our Python code.

Instead we should have something like:

prompts/
    naive.txt
    few_shot.txt
    chain_of_thought.txt
    structured.txt

Then Python loads these files.

---

# 10. test data

We will need:

20 inputs

and their:

20 expected outputs / ground truths.

Something like:
data/
    test_cases.json

Each test case could conceptually contain:

{
    "input": "...",
    "expected": {
        ...
    }
}

This will make automated evaluation easier.

---

# 11. Expected project structure

The final project could look approximately like this:

prompt-lab/
│
├── prompts/
│   ├── naive.txt
│   ├── few_shot.txt
│   ├── chain_of_thought.txt
│   └── structured.txt
│
├── data/
│   └── test_cases.json
│
├── results/
│   └── results.json
│
├── src/
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── llm.py
│   ├── loader.py
│   └── evaluator.py
│
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
└── .gitignore


# 12. Written comparison

The second part of the assignment is the written comparison.

After running the experiment, we should explain:

## 1. What task did we choose?

Example:

"Extract structured job information from unstructured job descriptions."

## 2. What were the four prompts?

- Naive
- Few-shot
- Chain-of-thought
- Structured-output

## 3. How did we evaluate them?

- Ground truth
- Field-level accuracy
- Completeness
- Format validity
- Overall score


## 4. Which prompt won?

We will identify the highest scoring prompt.

## 5. Why did it win?

We should explain based on the results.

For example:

"Structured output prompting performed best because the task required extracting multiple fields into a predictable format. The strict schema reduced missing fields and formatting errors."



# 13. One important calculation

We have: 20 inputs

and:

4 prompts

Therefore:

20 × 4 = 80 model evaluations

So our experiment will generate approximately:

80 model responses

Then we evaluate those 80 responses.

This is why we need automation instead of manually testing everything.
